# Lottery-Project
My first solidity project!

A very rudimentary implementation of a (psuedo) random lottery where a user can enter with a minimum amount of ether (.01), and then the manager of the contract can call the pickWinner function to distibute the contract balance to a lucky winner.

Obviously this is for fun, and could be gamed. Don't use this lmao

I also included a quick react app that provides the user with a UI for all of those options. Use 'npm start' in your directory to launch it locally.
